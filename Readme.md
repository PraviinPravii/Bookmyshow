## Design Pattern

The Bookmyshow backend application follows the [design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) to ensure maintainability, scalability, and readability of the codebase. The specific design pattern used may vary depending on the application's requirements. Some common design patterns for Spring Boot applications include:

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: A common pattern for structuring web applications. It separates the application into three interconnected components: Model (data), View (user interface), and Controller (request handling).

- **Repository Pattern**: This pattern is often used for database interactions, providing a clean separation between the data access layer and the business logic.

- **Service Layer**: The service layer pattern is used to separate business logic from the controller and data access layers, making the code more modular and maintainable.

Please specify the design pattern used in your application and provide relevant details.

## Database Connection

The Bookmyshow backend application is connected to a MySQL database to persist and retrieve data. To configure the database connection, you will need to update the application properties (typically found in `src/main/resources/application.properties` or `src/main/resources/application.yml`) with your database credentials and connection details.

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bookmyshow
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
